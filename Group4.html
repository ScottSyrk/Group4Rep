    <h1> Lentil spheres recipe!</h1>

    <p>This meal is a delicious option for those who are looking to try out something different. The ingredient list might sound fancy but nothing to be scared of, as most of the ingredients can easily be found at stores.</p>

    <p>For ingredients, here is what we need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of red lentils</li>
        <li>1 cup of fine bulgur wheat</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>Some spring onions</li>
        <li>Some cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste and 1 tbs of red pepper paste</li>
        <li>3 cups of water</li>
        <li>Salt, red pepper flakes, cumin</li>
        <li>1-2 lemons for juice</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First, the lentils need to be washed and put in a large pan, followed by 3 cups of water. Then boil it until the lentils are soft. Remove from stove.</li>
        <li>We then need to add the bulgur wheat and close the lid. The heat of the water should make the bulgur wheat softer while we prepare the other ingredients, for about 25-30 min.</li>
        <li>In another pan, sautee the diced onion with the tomato and pepper paste. Then we add this mixture to the red lentil-bulgur mixture and mix until the pepper paste mixture is absorbed by the lentil-bulgur mix.</li>
        <li>Finally, we add the remaining ingredients after chopping the spring onions, cilantro and mixing in the spices, as well as the olive oil. Everything is mixed until all the ingredients are equally mixed in with the lentils and bulgur.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice to taste to your liking!</li>

    </ol>

    <p>You can serve this in between romaine lettuce leaves, or make sphere shapes in your hand and serve on a plate with lettuce and lemon on the side for garnish.</p>
