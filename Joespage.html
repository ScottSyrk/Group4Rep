   <H2>INSTRUCTIONS</H2> <br></center>
<h3>The Cake:</h3>
   
    <ol>
       <li> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350Â°F. Generously coat a 12-cup Bundt pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Dust with the 2 tablespoons of flour and tap out any excess; set aside.
       </li>

        <li>Place the remaining 3 cups flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat or whisk to combine. Add the milk, oil or butter, eggs, and vanilla and beat with an electric hand mixer or in the stand mixer on medium speed until smooth, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Fold in the apples with a rubber spatula.
      </li>

        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the cake is lightly browned, springs back when lightly pressed with a finger, and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
        </li>

        <li> Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the pan to loosen the cake and flip it out of the pan onto a wire rack. Cool completely before glazing.<br>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Glaze:</h3>
    <OL>
       <li> Place the cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, use an electric hand mixer, small food processor, or sturdy whisk.) Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low, gradually add the powdered sugar, and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add the milk and vanilla and mix on low speed until smooth and creamy, about 15 seconds.
       </li>

       <li> Pour the glaze over the cooled cake, making sure that the glaze drips down the sides of the cake. Sprinkle with the chopped  walnuts or pecans, if using.
        </li>
        <br>
    </OL>
        
    
    <h3>Recipe Notes</h3><br>
    
    Storage: The glazed cake can be wrapped with plastic wrap after the glaze has set. Refrigerate for up to 5 days. Let come to room temperature before serving.
