    <h3>Description</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <p1>    Although this meal can be eaten all year round, this is a Holiday dish   for me and my children. Another name for this dish is Arroz con grandules. This meal is a warm hearty treat for any occassion. This recipe does include pigeon peas but I would like to assure you that there are no pigeons involved in the making of this dish. Pigeon peas are a tropical pea-like seed from the legume family. Pigeon peas are rich in ptasssium, protien, and fiber. They are delicous if you ask me.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Any ingredients can be adjusted to your taste.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups of medium grain rice</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Water</li>
        <li>1 Can of Pigeon Peas (with water, do not rinse)</li>
        <li>Small cooked ham cubed or diced depending on preference</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Sofrito (I use Goya brand)</li>
        <li>1 Packet of Sazon (I also use Goya brand of this as seen in photo above)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>2 TBS Canola Oil</li>
        <li>1 TBS Tomato Suace</li>
        <li>1 Handful of sliced green Spanish olives (As big or as small of a handful as you would like)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice in a colander and set aside. (This removes all the extra starch from the rice, you don't want to skip this step!)</li>
        <li>Place Sofrito, oil, tomato sauce, and salt in the pot. Let it sautee for a few minutes, then add the ham and pigeon peas. (use the whole can, adding the water with the peas)</li>
        <li>place the water in the pot and add the packet of Sazon (at this point you can also add the olives). Cover the pot and let the ingredients boil in the water.</li>
        <li>When the water boils, put in the rice and stir it all around so that it mixes. DO NOT COVER THE POT YET. I usually will set my gas stove on high until the water boils and then when I put in the rice, I lower it to 5 until the water dries, meaning that you won't see it covering the rice but right at the same level. This doesn't take very long (maybe 5 minutes but keep an eye on it)</li>
        <li>At that point stir the rice again, LOWER the heat to 3 and cover the pot. Let the rice cook for about 15 minutes and then uncover (let the steamy water from the cover fall over the rice), stir and cover again and let it cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. The rice should be fully cooked, soft but not overdone but NEVER aldente. Remember, the secret tot he perfect rice is NOT stirring it too many times. A total of 3 times is plenty. Also uncovering and covering it too much also affects the cooking. 
            ENJOY!!!
